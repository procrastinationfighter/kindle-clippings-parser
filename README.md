# Kindle clippings parser
This short script allows you to parse the `MyClippings.txt` file from your Kindle.
### Usage
`python main.py <input file path> <output file path>`
### Input
I based the input form on the one produced by my 10th Generation Kindle. In case of any doubt, an example input can be seen in the `example.txt` file.
### Output
The clipping are grouped by source document's name, inside apostrophes and separated by commas.
